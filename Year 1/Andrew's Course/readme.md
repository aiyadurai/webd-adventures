# Andrew's Course

This course was known as WEBD-112, or `Interactive Production 1`. It was all about the process, which is important to understanding our roles as Web Designers, Developers, or hell, even head-honchos.

What did we do? Good question, o curious reader.

* Cover the nature of RFPs & subsequent stuff.
* Use RFPs in a mock scenario.
* Conduct workflow planning in mock scenarios.
* Do some killer design-work & dev-work.
* **Pool everything during an Integrative Week**

## Assignments

* Post-RFP Workflow
